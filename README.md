# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

In this repository, GeoJSON earthquake data from the US geological survey website is plotted using an API request from MapBox to show the magnitude of each earthquake through size and color. The position of the earthquakes along the tectonic plates is also visible. Three different map views are available (Streets, Satellite, and Navigation Night), with the possibility of overlaying earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates either separately or together on the maps.
